# Important Style

## Passive Voice
- Stick to active voice and state clearly who the culprit is.
- Do not mix in one sentence parts that contain words ending with ing with parts cast in passive voice.
    - Bad: The fire can be extinguished quickly by pouring water on the flame.
    - Good: To extinguish the fire qucikly, you can pour water on the flame.
    - Good: If you want to put out a fire qickly, then drown the flame in water.
- Do not mix infinitve with passiv voice (reason same as above).

## Adressing The Reader And Yourself
- Call the reader **you** and not the **reader**.
- Do not use **one**.
- Inlcude youself and the reader to **we** when acting as a guide.

## Only
- **Only** modifies the word after it. Double check your intention when using **Only**.
- Three Examples with three different meanings:
    - Only I love you. (John or Harry do not love you.)
    - I only love you. (I do not respect you.)
    - I love only you. (I do not love John.)

## Also
- Check the position of *also*. Like *only* it can have different meaning based on the position.

## Redundant terms
- Avoid redundant phrases.
- Avoid redundant words (words with the same meaning).
- Express a thought only once!

## Pronouns
- Check if your pronouns point to the correct subject.
    - Good: Max admired the singer's dress; he had never seen so many sequins.
    - Bad: The ball bounced off the pavement and through the window; it was cracked already.
    - The second sentence is a bad link.
- Never use **it** as pronoun and as a anticipatory **it** in one sentence
    - Bad: Max thought that **it** was a good idea to write the book first, and then to worry about designing the various parts of **it**.
- Take the least expected gender for subjects, that have an elusive gender (e.g., doctor or cleaner).

## Undefined This These That and Some
- Repeat after **this, these, that** and **some** the noun of the previous sentence its referring to.
- Because you know does not mean the reader knows.

## Key Terms
- Define key term in your text.
- Define them before you begin to write.
- State them most clearly and understandable for the reader.
- Use highlights or italic to emphasise the key term.  

## Colon
- Its an expansion/connection to the previous sentence. Use it for:
    1. Lists
    2. Further explanations (added information)
- A capital letter after a colon for a new sentence.
- A lower letter for lists.
- Only use a colon at the end that constitutes a **complete** sentence!
    - Bad: To collect all stars, you:
        1. move a stone.
        2. find the treasure.
        3. grab the star.
    - Good: To collect all stars, you
        1. move a stone.
        2. find the treasure.
        3. grab the star.

- For a logical pause, or whenever you begin a new thought.
    - Bad: Max wanted to buy pasta so he went to Edeka.
    - Good: Max wanted to buy pasta, so he went to Edeka.

## Exclamation Point
- Use exclamation points for **emphasizing** rather than surprising or earth-shaking material.

        - Good: We need to develop a more intuitive **front end**.

        - Good: This system is **user friendly**.
        - Good: The **user-friendly** system is good.
- Think about hyphenation as a mathematical operation.
    - Example: Internet-specific web development is hard.

        - Example: Max -- that is the man asking for information -- has been cooking up a new theory.

## Number Spelling

- Use numbers for counting.
    - Example: The algorithm stopped on step 5.
- Spell out fractions.

## Lists

### Intext Lists
- To emphasise the numbers (step numbers) and less the entry itself.
- Good: Just remember two rules: (1) the entries are only clauses in a sentence, and (2) they should be separated by commas or semicolons.
- It is wrong to set each entry as a whole sentence, else use *First*, *Second*, and so on.

    3. *To*
    4. Conjunctions (*and, or*, and so on)
    5. Special words

## Its and Its
- Be careful about the meaning of *its* in your text.
- Check if you really mean *its* or *it's*.
- You can avoid it if you always write *it's* as *it is* which intrinsically checks your thoughts.
- Its = possessive (It has or owns something)
- It's = it is.
    - Example: Can you hear that noise? Where do you think it‚Äôs (it is) coming from? It‚Äôs (it is) nearly the end of the month. It‚Äôs (it has) gone really quickly.
    - Example: Every house in the street has got its own garage.

## Comparatives
- If you use term for comparison, such as, *bigger, better,* and so on, do not leave out the object you compare to. Its critical information.
    - Bad: Max wanted a bigger boat.
    - Good. Max wanted a bigger boat than the rest of the ships in the harbour.
- Just ask yourself, **"Against What?"** and fill in the void.

## Tables
- A table title do not include detailed information. Keep it very short. (It has less information than a figure caption.)
- Always indicate the unit of the column. Best mark it in parentheses or square brackets.

## Tense
- **Do not change the tense in one part** of your work.
- Stick to a tense.
- If sections have the same character, then use the same tense in all sections. For example, throughout a complete book.

## Nonwords Prefixwords Suffixwords
- [Article1](https://www.dailywritingtips.com/non-hyphenation-is-a-nonstarter/)
- [Article2](http://www.thewriter.com/what-we-think/style-guide/to-hyphenate-or-not-to-hyphenate/)
- Do not hyphen **most** nonwords. Check, some are hyphened!!
    - Example: noncanonical
- Hyphen things, where the second word starts with a capital letter.
    - Example: non-Unix
- Use a hyphen with prefixes or suffixes (such as *-like*) when you have repeated letters in a word, but you pronounce them separately
    - Example: shell-like or anti-inflammatory.
- Use a hyphen if there‚Äôs a risk of mispronouncing a word.
    - Example: co-worker
- Use hyphenate words that are spelt the same but can have very different meanings or different pronunciations.
    - Example: recreation (fun) and re-creation (creating again).
- Try to avoid hyphenation in pre- and suffixwords.

## Missing That
- Do not leave out *that*.

## Solidus
- Never use */* in your work.

## Equations
- Variables in italic
- Constants in roman
- Mathematical expression should have a similar style in text as well as in figures.
- Equation inside of a sentence, even as a block, should be punctuated. So use periods and commas.

## Italic Type
- Use it for:
    1. Emphasizing words
    2. Foreign words or phrases, except anglicisms
    3. Titles of books, movies and songs
    4. Variables

## Truncated Words
- Always use full words.
    - Example: Laboratory instead of lab

## Object Modifier Activity

    - Good: Max once tried to log in from the airplane.

## Respectively
- Respectively indicates what object or thing belongs with what other object or thing.
- Place a comma before respectively.
- Place respectively after the terms to which it applies.
    - Good: Max, and Eric are married to Jude and Kyle, respectively.

## Possessives
- Adding *('s)* indicates a possession.
- Things ending in *s* gets an *(')*.
    - Good: Mr. Langes' book is good.
- If two or more possess the same item, just add *('s)* to one of them.
    - Good: Max and Linda's chicken flew away.

## Both

- We don‚Äôt use *both* with a negative verb; we use *either* instead.
    - Good: There was not a considerable difference in percentages for **either** sex in terms of having a Bachelor‚Äôs degree.
- When we use the verb be as a main verb, *both* comes after the verb.
    Bad: These films both are famous.
    Good: These films are both famous.
- Both is always plural, so no *s* at the end of a verb that follows both.

## URLs
- Check if your urls are working.
- Set the urls as a footnote, so it will not destroy the style of your document.

## From General to Specific
- When you write a paragraph like results or discussion, go always from the general case to the specific.
- First describe a general case, with general findings.
- Then dig deeper and give specific examples.

## Measurements
- Put a space between abbreviations of measurements (e.g., 10 mm, 10 h, 10 km)
- Put **not** a space between symbols of measurements (e.g., 10$, 10%, 10¬∞)
